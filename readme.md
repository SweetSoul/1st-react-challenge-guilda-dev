# 1st React Challenge - Guilda Dev
Welcome everyone! This is our first code challenge and we are very proud to do it.
Below you will find all the instructions needed to build the app, but try to be creative and surprise us, why not.

We are building our website and all projects will be displayed as our members portfolio.

All projects will be reviewed by senior professionals and will have immersive feedback at each point of improvement/optimization culminating in an individual mentorship with each participant. We target junior devs but mid-levels can and will be accepted as well.

This challenge is based on a company test, so you could end up seeing this in an interview ðŸ˜‰
